- Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).



For example, this binary tree [1,2,2,3,4,4,3] is symmetric:


    1

   / \

  2   2

 / \ / \

3  4 4  3




But the following [1,2,2,null,3,null,3] is not:


    1

   / \

  2   2

   \   \

   3    3
