- Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

- For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as:

- a binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1.

 

Example 1:


Given the following tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]:

    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7

Return true.




Example 2:

Given the following tree [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]:

       1
      / \
     2   2
    / \
   3   3
  / \
 4   4

Return false.
