- Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.


#push(x) -- Push element x onto stack.
#pop() -- Removes the element on top of the stack.
#top() -- Get the top element.
#getMin() -- Retrieve the minimum element in the stack.




Example:

MinStack minStack = new MinStack();
minStack.push(-2);
minStack.push(0);
minStack.push(-3);
minStack.getMin();   --> Returns -3.
minStack.pop();
minStack.top();      --> Returns 0.
minStack.getMin();   --> Returns -2.
