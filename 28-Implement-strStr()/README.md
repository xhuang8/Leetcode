- Implement strStr().

- Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack."".


Example 1:

Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"

Output: 2



Example 2:

Input: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"

Output: -1



Clarification:

What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().
