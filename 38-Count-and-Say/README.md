- The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:

1.     1

2.     11

3.     21

4.     1211

5.     111221


- 1 is read off as "one 1" or 11.

11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21.

21 is read off as "one 2, then one 1" or 1211.


- Given an integer n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, generate the nth term of the count-and-say sequence.

- Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.


Example 1:

Input: 1

Output: "1"


Example 2:

Input: 4

Output: "1211"
