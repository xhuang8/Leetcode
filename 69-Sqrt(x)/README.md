- Implement int sqrt(int x).

- Compute and return the square root of x, where x is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

- Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.



Example 1:


Input: 4

Output: 2



Example 2:

Input: 8

Output: 2

Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since 
             the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
