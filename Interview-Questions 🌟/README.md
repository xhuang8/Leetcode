# Some basic algorithm

1. Given an unsorted array of n elements, find if the element k is present in the array or not.

2. Given two integers, l and r, print all the odd numbers between l and r(l and r inclusive). The function must return an array of integers denoting the odd numbers between l and r.

3. Given a hex string, convert that string to a decimal integer C.
(Note: hex string should have upper and lowercase)

4. Counting how many 1-bits
Given an integer n, ccomplete the function getOneBits.

The function must return a results array with the number of 1's stored at results[0] followed by the position of all 1's in its binary representation in ascending order

sample case: sample input: n = 161 sample output: 3 1 3 8 explanation: 161 convert to 1010 0001

5. Removing duplicates of an array and returning an array of only unique elements
